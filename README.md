### Future Implementations


### Accessibility

In my project I have added aria-labels and names to all my links and buttons to enable screen readers to understand each element. I have run a lighthouse test and a wave test to ensure I have met the requirements needed to be accessible friendly.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Python

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.
