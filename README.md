# MUDDY PAWS

**Project Overview**

**Dog Grooming Business Management System**

This project is a web application designed specifically for a small dog grooming business. The primary goal of this system is to streamline the management of customer and pet information, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the business's booking process.

This web application serves as a vital tool for the dog grooming business owner, enabling her to slowly transition from paper-based bookings to a more organized digital system. By centralizing customer and pet information, the application not only saves time but also enhances customer service by allowing for more personalized interactions.

I have many future features planned for this project which I will outline further into the Readme.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

Shown below are my User Stories

### Colour Scheme

I chose this colour palette as the colours match the asthetic in the grooming parlour.

### Future Implementations


### Accessibility

In my project I have added aria-labels and names to all my links and buttons to enable screen readers to understand each element. I have run a lighthouse test and a wave test to ensure I have met the requirements needed to be accessible friendly.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Python

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.
