# MUDDY PAWS

**Project Overview**

**Dog Grooming Business Management System**

This project is a web application designed specifically for a small dog grooming business. The primary goal of this system is to streamline the management of customer and pet information, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the business's booking process.

This web application serves as a vital tool for the dog grooming business owner, enabling her to slowly transition from paper-based bookings to a more organized digital system. By centralizing customer and pet information, the application not only saves time but also enhances customer service by allowing for more personalized interactions.

I have many future features planned for this project which I will outline further into the Readme.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

During the development process, it became clear that creating a complete booking system within the given timeframe was more challenging than initially anticipated. As a result, the project scope was adjusted to focus on core functionalities that could be successfully implemented and serve as a foundation for future development.

Shown below is my Project Board which shows the features i was not able to implement in the given timeline.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I chose this colour palette as the colours match the asthetic in the grooming parlour.

### Typography

The font I used was:
![Just Another Hand Font](/documentation/testing/Font.png)

I chose this font because it wasnt too robotic, as the business is a small local business, the owner wanted it to feel warm and welcoming.

### Imagery

The imagery I used throughout the site was provided by the business owner. 

### Wireframes

I made my wireframes using Figma. As the scope of the project changed there are some differences from the wireframes to the finished product however they are still very similar to the expected outcome.

## Features

My site is made up of the Home page, Sign in page, Sign up page, Sign out page, Dashboard, Bookings, Add Pet, Edit Pet and Delete Pet pages.

### General features on each page

General features that reoccur on each page are the navbar, footer, favicon and background.
Each page inlcudes the base.HTML which includes all these features.

### Future Implementations

I have many future enhancements lined up. As my initial plan was to create the booking system that will be the next feature I will implement. Along with the hopes of implementing an automated reminder for customers with bookings too.

After this feature I would love to add a reviews section in order to allow customers to give feedback to the business and to show new customers the feedback that has been left.

I would be interested in implementing a social account login too.

### Accessibility

In my project I have added aria-labels and names to all my links and buttons to enable screen readers to understand each element. I have run a lighthouse test and a wave test to ensure I have met the requirements needed to be accessible friendly.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Python

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- Git
- GitHub
- GitPod
- Bootstrap


Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.
